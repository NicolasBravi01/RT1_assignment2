 # Research Track 1, Assignment 2
Second assignment of Research Track 1 course at UniGe Robotics Engineering.

## Introduction
This project entails the development of three ROS (Robot Operating System) nodes to effectively maneuver a robot in a simulated 3D environment. The main node is designed for user interaction, allowing the specification and cancellation of target coordinates for the robot. One other node is dedicated to showing the coordinates of the last target sent by the user. The other node has to calculate and report the distance of the robot from its target and its average speed. We used Rviz and Gazebo for the simulation.

### Simulator
For this assignment, it was used Gazebo and Rviz within ROS. Gazebo served as the 3D simulation environment to test and refine the robot's movements, while Rviz was used for detailed 3D visualization, with also the information of the robot's sensor.
